# Sprint 3A Final Report (Aborted)

**Sprint:** 3A - Workflow Maturation & Clean Slate (Phase 1)  
**Status:** ABORTED (Stop-the-Line Event #2)  
**Start Time:** 9:10 AM PT, October 15, 2025  
**Abort Time:** 11:00 AM PT, October 15, 2025  
**Duration:** 1h 50m  
**Completion:** 25% (Stage 1 complete locally, Stages 2-4 blocked)

## Executive Summary

Sprint 3A was aborted due to infrastructure authentication/permissions blockers discovered during Stage 1. While all planned Stage 1 work was completed successfully locally, the inability to push branches to remote repositories due to OAuth token limitations prevented validation of critical CodeQL architecture fixes and CI improvements. The sprint requires infrastructure hardening before retry.

## Work Completed

### ‚úÖ Stage 1: CodeQL + CI Infrastructure [COMPLETED LOCALLY]
**Duration:** 9:10 AM - 9:25 AM PT (15 minutes)

#### WP1.1: Phoenix CodeQL Architecture Fix ‚úÖ
- **Problem Identified:** x86_64 vs arm64 architecture mismatch
- **Solution Implemented:** Changed CodeQL runner from `macos-14` to `macos-14-arm64`
- **Additional Changes:**
  - Updated CI path filters to include `.underlord/**`
  - Increased PR Guard threshold from 600 to 1200 lines
- **Status:** Committed locally, not validated

#### WP1.2: Bedrock CI Validation ‚úÖ
- **Changes Made:** Updated CI path filters to include `.underlord/**`
- **Consistency:** Ensured CI consistency between Phoenix and Bedrock
- **Status:** Committed locally, not validated

### ‚ùå Stage 2: Dependabot Automation [BLOCKED]
**Status:** Not started due to stop-the-line event

### ‚ùå Stage 3: Doxygen + Documentation [BLOCKED]
**Status:** Not started due to stop-the-line event

### ‚ùå Stage 4: Sprint Close [BLOCKED]
**Status:** Not started due to stop-the-line event

## Issues Encountered

### üõë Stop-the-Line Events
**Event #1:** 10:15 AM PT - Infrastructure validation blocked, execution gaps discovered  
**Event #2:** 11:00 AM PT - Infrastructure not sprint-ready (authentication/permissions blocker)

#### Primary Issues
1. **Branch Push Failure:** sprint-003 branches not pushed to origin
2. **CI Validation Blocked:** Cannot validate changes without GitHub Actions
3. **Execution Gap:** Push operations not included in approved plan
4. **Authentication Insufficient:** OAuth token lacks `workflow` scope
5. **No SSH Alternative:** No SSH keys configured on EC2 instance
6. **Fork Topology Unclear:** Phoenix is fork, canonical push target ambiguous
7. **Pre-flight Incomplete:** Does not test actual push capability or permissions

#### Impact
- **CodeQL Fix Untested:** Architecture fix not validated
- **CI Changes Untested:** Path filters not validated
- **Work Preservation:** All work preserved locally
- **Timeline Impact:** Sprint 3A aborted, requires infrastructure hardening

## Technical Changes Made

### Phoenix Repository
- **CodeQL Runner:** `macos-14` ‚Üí `macos-14-arm64`
- **CI Path Filters:** Added `.underlord/**`
- **PR Guard Threshold:** 600 ‚Üí 1200 lines
- **Files Modified:**
  - `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/pr-guard.yml`

### Bedrock Repository
- **CI Path Filters:** Added `.underlord/**`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Branch Status

### Local Branches
- **Phoenix:** `sprint-003` (1 commit ahead of main)
- **Bedrock:** `sprint-003` (1 commit ahead of main)
- **Sub-branches:** Merged and deleted locally

### Remote Status
- **Phoenix:** sprint-003 branch NOT pushed to origin (authentication blocker)
- **Bedrock:** sprint-003 branch NOT pushed to origin (authentication blocker)
- **Validation:** Cannot validate changes without remote CI runs

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **CodeQL Fix Untested:** Critical architecture fix not validated
- **CI Changes Untested:** Path filter changes not validated
- **Work Preservation:** Local changes not backed up remotely
- **Infrastructure Gap:** Authentication/permissions not sprint-ready

### Medium Risk
- **Timeline Impact:** Sprint 3A aborted, may affect Sprint 3B
- **Recovery Complexity:** Infrastructure hardening required before retry

### Low Risk
- **Data Loss:** All work preserved locally
- **Rollback Available:** Can revert to main if needed

## Lessons Learned

### Infrastructure Readiness
1. **Authentication Validation:** Must test actual push capability, not just token presence
2. **Repository Topology:** Must clarify fork relationships and push targets
3. **Pre-flight Enhancement:** Must include infrastructure validation
4. **Alternative Auth:** Must configure SSH as backup authentication

### Sprint Planning
1. **Infrastructure First:** Infrastructure hardening must precede sprint execution
2. **Validation Depth:** Pre-flight must test actual operations, not just presence
3. **Recovery Planning:** Must have clear recovery path for infrastructure issues
4. **Execution Plan Gap:** Should have included explicit push operations

## Next Sprint: 3A-Infra (Infrastructure Readiness Validation)

**Objective:** Harden infrastructure to be genuinely sprint-ready  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes  
**Deliverables:**
- SSH authentication configured and tested
- Repository topology clarified and documented
- Dummy push test validates full pipeline
- Enhanced pre-flight script includes infrastructure checks
- CI trigger verified working

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Execute 3A-Infra:** Infrastructure readiness validation sprint
2. **Harden Infrastructure:** Configure authentication and permissions
3. **Validate Pipeline:** Test full push-to-CI pipeline
4. **Update Plan:** Include explicit push operations in future plans

### Path Forward Options

#### Option 1: Execute 3A-Infra, Then Resume
- Execute infrastructure hardening sprint
- Resume Sprint 3A with validated infrastructure
- **Risk:** Medium (infrastructure hardening required)
- **Timeline:** +1 hour

#### Option 2: Defer to Sprint 3B
- Document current state
- Defer remaining work to Sprint 3B
- Focus on other priorities
- **Risk:** Low (deferred work)
- **Timeline:** No additional time

## Metrics

- **Total Time:** 1h 50m
- **Work Completed:** 25% (Stage 1, local only)
- **Branches Created:** 2 (local only)
- **Commits Made:** 2 (local only)
- **Issues Identified:** 9 (5 in Event #1, 4 in Event #2)
- **Blocking Issues:** 7 (3 in Event #1, 4 in Event #2)
- **Stop-the-Line Events:** 2

## Next Steps

1. **Execute 3A-Infra:** Infrastructure readiness validation sprint
2. **Harden Infrastructure:** Configure authentication and permissions
3. **Validate Pipeline:** Test full push-to-CI pipeline
4. **Restart Sprint:** Resume as Sprint 3A or 3B after infrastructure ready
