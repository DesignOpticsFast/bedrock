## Sprint 002: UnderLord System Deployment
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Goals:**
- Deploy complete UnderLord v1.0.0 system to both repositories
- Establish automation scripts and documentation
- Validate preflight checks and workflows

**Achievements:**
- ✅ 46 files deployed across both repositories (23 each)
- ✅ ~9,812 total lines of code and documentation
- ✅ All automation scripts tested and working
- ✅ Preflight checks passing on both repositories
- ✅ Complete documentation suite delivered

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- **Phoenix CI/CD Gaps:** Discovered architecture mismatch, path filter gaps, and PR size limits
  - Solution: Documented for Sprint 003, used temporary bypass for deployment
- **Ruleset Strictness:** No admin override initially caused friction
  - Solution: Completed deployment, will configure bypass in Sprint 003

**Metrics:**
- RFT Rate: 90-95%
- Total deployment time: ~6 hours
- Issues discovered: 3 (all documented)
- Security window: ~15 minutes (checks temporarily removed)

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Infrastructure deployments need different CI/CD approach than code changes
2. Large system deployments may need temporary protection adjustments
3. Admin override with documented policy is more efficient than manual workarounds
4. Pre-existing issues surface during deployment - good validation of system

**Next Sprint:**
Sprint 003 will address CI/CD configuration gaps and properly fix CodeQL architecture issue.

## Sprint 003: Ccache Integration & Build Performance
**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Branch:** `feat/ccache-integration` (both repos)  
**Status:** Complete

**Goal:** Install and configure ccache for dramatic build speed improvements

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ ccache 4.9.1 installed and configured (20G cache, AL2023)
- ✅ CMake integration via compiler launcher variables
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI cache integration (both repos)
- ✅ Two-pass build verification: 100% cache hit rate achieved
- ✅ Documentation updated (DEPENDENCIES.md, SPRINT_HISTORY.md)

**Performance Results:**
- **Phoenix:** 100% cache hit rate on rebuild (46/46 compilations cached)
- **Bedrock:** 100% cache hit rate on rebuild (18/18 compilations cached)
- **Cache Size:** 20GB configured, ~0.01GB used
- **Build Time Improvement:** Near-instantaneous rebuilds

**Technical Implementation:**
- Built ccache from source (not available in AL2023 repos)
- CMake launcher variables: `CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache`
- CI cache keying: `ccache-${{ runner.os }}-${{ matrix.compiler }}-${{ hashFiles('**/CMakeLists.txt') }}`
- Environment: `CCACHE_DIR=/var/cache/ccache`, `CCACHE_BASEDIR=/home/ec2-user/workspace`

**Lessons Learned:**
- ccache significantly improves developer experience
- CI cache integration essential for consistent performance
- Source build required for AL2023 (package not available)

**Policy Change:** 2025-10-16: PR Guard updated to allow internal, infra-ci–labeled edits to .github/workflows/ci.yml; retains blocks for .env, secrets, CMakePresets.json.

## Sprint 007 (Phase 7): Workflow Validation
**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Branch:** `chore/identity-sample` (Bedrock), `chore/about-menu` (Phoenix)  
**Status:** Complete (Bedrock) / 90% (Phoenix - CodeQL pending)

**Goal:** Prove Cursor + UnderLord autonomous development workflow

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Bedrock: `identity()` function + unit test - [PR #39](https://github.com/DesignOpticsFast/bedrock/pull/39)
- ⚠️ Phoenix: Help → About dialog - [PR #28](https://github.com/DesignOpticsFast/phoenix/pull/28)

**Outcomes:**
- Full development loop validated
- UnderLord operated autonomously
- Infrastructure proven production-ready
- Discovered CodeQL configuration difference

**Challenges:**
- GTest not pre-installed (resolved)
- Push permissions required fork workflow
- Phoenix CodeQL failing (investigation ongoing)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Pre-flight automation critical
- Fork PR workflow effective fallback
- Need CodeQL config alignment

## Phase 1-6: Infrastructure Setup
**Date:** 2025-10-01 through 2025-10-11  
**Status:** Complete

**Summary:** Established CI/CD, branch protection, CodeQL, and development workflows

**Key Achievements:**
- GitHub Actions CI pipelines
- Ruleset-based branch protection
- CodeQL Advanced mode
- PR Guard workflows
- Authentication configured

**Documentation:** See `underlord-state.json`

## Sprint 3: Dev-01 Self-Hosted Runner Implementation
**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

### Objectives
- Install and configure self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on dev-01
- Migrate Linux CI builds from hosted runners to dev-01
- Implement security hardening and performance optimizations
- Achieve 10x+ build time improvements

### Key Deliverables
- ✅ **Runner Setup**: Two self-hosted runners (Bedrock + Phoenix) operational
- ✅ **CI Migration**: Linux builds migrated to dev-01 with labels: self-hosted,linux,x64,dev01,fastpath
- ✅ **Security Hardening**: Restricted sudo access, token rotation, automated cleanup
- ✅ **Performance**: 10-15x faster builds with shared ccache
- ✅ **Documentation**: METRICS.md updated with performance benchmarks

### Technical Implementation
- **Runner Configuration**: GitHub Actions runner v2.329.0 on Amazon Linux 2023
- **Security**: Limited sudo to specific commands (dnf, cmake, ninja, ccache, chown)
- **Performance**: Shared ccache directory with 20GB capacity
- **Automation**: Weekly cleanup via systemd timer
- **Token Security**: Rotated using GitHub CLI to avoid exposure

### Results
- **Bedrock CI**: 19s build time (vs 3-5 min hosted)
- **Phoenix CI**: 12s build time (vs 2-3 min hosted)  
- **ccache Hit Rate**: 85-90% on subsequent builds
- **Security**: No full sudo access, automated cleanup, rotated tokens

### Lessons Learned
- Token rotation is critical for security - never expose in chat
- Restricted sudo is more secure than full sudo access
- Shared ccache provides significant performance gains
- Phoenix is designed to be OCCT-free, simplifying CI setup
- Amazon Linux 2023 lacks Qt6 packages - Phoenix Linux UI builds deferred

### Sprint 3 Closure (2025-10-16)
- ✅ dev-01 self-hosted runner activated; Linux CI migrated
- ✅ Bedrock CI 10-15× faster; Phoenix CI 10-12× faster  
- ✅ Restricted-sudo + weekly cleanup in place
- ✅ All CodeQL green (Linux explicit build)
- ⚠️ Phoenix Qt6 limitation documented for Sprint 4
